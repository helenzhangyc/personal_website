My name is Helen Zhang (张易成), a third year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I have a strong passion for technology and a deep interest in full stack development and mathematics.

As a computer science student, I have a solid foundation in various programming languages, data structures, and algorithms. I believe that good understanding of these concepts is essential for any software developer. This is why I strive to constantly improve my skills and expand knowledge in these areas.

I'm also fascinated by machine learning and its potential to solve complex problems in various fields. I'm determined to learn more about this field and to apply my knowledge to real-world projects.

In my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and work on personal projects that challenge me and help me expand my skill set.

Overall, I'm a highly motivated and driven individual who is always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I'm excited to see where my passion for technology will take me in the future and I hope you'll join me on this journey!
